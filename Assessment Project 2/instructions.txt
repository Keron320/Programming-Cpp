Thank you for playing my game!

The game is easy to learn but hard to master.
When the game starts, random objects are popping up on the screen with letters on them.
Your task is to react to the letters on time by pressing exact same letter on a keyboard.
If you fail to do so you will lose 1 Health point. Lose them all and the game is over.
Each correct answer gives you 100 points and speeds up the game.

Play for fun and compete with your friends!
